## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu. 


## Atleast one change to every week:
### Week 1:
  * New Dad Left sing sprite 
  * Unused stage lights are now used
### Week 2:
  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does "Hey!" animations
  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster
### Week 3:
  * BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song
### Week 4:
  * Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's :eyes:)
  * Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :(
### Week 5:
  * Bottom Boppers and GF does "Hey!" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog
  * On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.
### Week 6:
  * On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene
  * Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the "Hey!" parts of the Instrumental

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod

* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu

* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.

# This isn't the true ProjectFNF repo!
  
A note on https://github.com/ProjectFNF/ProjectFNF  
So here's the story in a nutshell:  
There was [ProjectFNF 1.0](https://github.com/aflacc/ProjectFNF) (which was mostly developed by [Zeptos](https://github.com/MagnusStrom)), then I decided to create ProjectFNF 2.0 using Psych Engine and [aflac](https://github.com/aflacc) agreed. Then, aflac gave permission to [east](https://github.com/EastDeveloper) to turn the ProjectFNF Discord server into South Engine, which east claims is "just a rebrand" which I never agreed in the first place (they countered this argument by saying that aflac gave them permission, and I couldn't do anything about it). During this time, I wasn't in the server, so I joined *after* the changes were made. I got frustrated and left. East then turned the Discord server back into ProjectFNF. I took a glance at their repo, and saw that [their](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139134145-e878d519-c6a6-4a9f-9df1-eb301ca17ad9.png) [commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139134360-4e1edca7-aa93-4ffd-aec2-1bffeebd3f6d.png) [history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61277953/139279406-e0275609-a95a-4d55-867f-c3ad8bcc3aff.png)
was a mess, filled with tons of "fix" and undescriptive commits. I decided to keep developing OG ProjectFNF 2.0 on my own
